[:point_left: Back to the main page](../../README.md)

**Development period:** 2021.11-2021.11.

**Practical application:** The weekend project[^1].

**Project purpose:** Research some trading algorithms


**Project description:** 
The program is able to connect to the exchange, listen to trade signals, analyze price trends, emulate buy and sell operations.
Also, it is able to download the real-time trading history and collect it in the SQL database.
Also, it is able to emulate the exchange for itself to play trading sessions on the historical data.
Actually, it allows choosing whether a user wants to connect: the Binance exchange or built-in emulator.

**Implementation technologies:** .Net5, WPF, Binance.Net library by JKorf, T-SQL and some subject area knowledge.

[^1]: It is needed sometimes to program something for yourself. To keep the knowledge in the actual state. To have something "good made" because it's made by yourself for yourself on the computer. To avoid hate evolving to the profession. And of course just for fun.
