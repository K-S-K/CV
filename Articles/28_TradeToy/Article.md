[:point_left: Back to the main page](../../README.md)

**Development period:** 2021.11-2021.11.

**Practical application:** The weekend project[^1].

**Project purpose:** Research of some trading algorithms

**Project description:** 
The program can connect to the exchange, listen to trade signals, analyze price trends, and emulate buy and sell operations.
Also, it can download the real-time trading history and collect it in the SQL database.
Also, it can emulate the exchange for itself to play trading sessions on historical data.
It allows choosing whether a user wants to connect: to the Binance exchange or the built-in emulator.

**Implementation technologies:** .Net5, WPF, Binance.Net library by JKorf, T-SQL and some subject area knowledge.

[^1]: It is sometimes necessary to program something for yourself. To keep the knowledge in the actual state. To have something "good made" because it's made by yourself on the computer. To avoid hate evolving to the profession. And, of course, just for fun.
