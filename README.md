# Introduction
I am a .Net software developer with 25 years of software development experience who still likes software development.
During my professional life, I worked on several projects in several areas. Some of them were interesting. Some of them were exciting.
Sometimes, projects get completed. Sometimes, projects evolve to their complete state, and a software developer cannot develop himself inside it, and the time comes to move on. 

What I can and want to propose:
- C#, 
- .Net, 
- Net Core / .Net 5+(.Net 7), 
- T-SQL.

What I've experienced in the rememberable past:
- Windows Desktop Development, including:
- WinForms - a lot of;
- WPF - some as MVC and direct;
- MFC - many years ago, not actual, but it was interesting;
- Network, Web, and Distributed software development, including distributed on MS cluster monitoring system;
- .Net Web Applications - several projects in the past, currently experimenting to learn.

What do I want to practice in:
- Microservice architecture;
- Cloud-distributed auto-scaling architecture;
- Azure API automation;
- AWS deployment infrastructure;
- AWS IoT infrastructure with ESP32;
- Microcontroller programming in C and C++ (currently experimenting with ESP32, want to touch PIC).

What do I want to touch:
- Ideally - real-life applications regarding natural things - nature, industry, etc.

What am I experienced in:
- Creating the electric energy billing software (electricity is my professional domain);
- Creating the software for monitoring the quality of other software working;
- Creating the exchange automatic trading software (several years of participation in this kind of project);
- Creating the crypto-exchange software (initially, it was an exciting challenge, but also it was an interesting project)
- Participation in the railway black box analysis project (a long time ago but very exciting)

The content of my bookshelf:
- Andrew Lock. ASP.NET Core in Action, Third Edition;
- Michael and Ruth Haephrati. Learning C++;
- Ronald Mak. Object-Oriented Software Design in C++;
- Naomi Ceder. The Quick Python Book.

What did I study recently:
- Linux C++ development;
- MongoDB on my little projects;
- FreeRTOS on home weekend projects;
- Amazon AWS on home weekend projects;
- MS Azure on Microsoft and the Linked In platforms.

What are my out-of-job interests:
- Family;
- Photography;
- Traveling around;
- Microcontrollers, home automation.
