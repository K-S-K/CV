# About me

## Introduction

I am a .Net software developer with 25 years of software development experience who still likes software development.
During my professional life, I worked on several projects in several areas. Some of them were interesting. Some of them were exciting.
Sometimes, projects get completed. Sometimes, projects evolve to their complete state, and a software developer cannot develop himself inside it, and the time comes to move on. 

**What I can and want to propose:**
- C# (12), 
- .Net Core (8),
- T-SQL (Not really hands-on, but have some).

**What I've experienced in (currently):**
- Dotnet core development for Linux-based platforms, including:
- - Scientific applications with a lot of calculations;
- - Monolith and distributed architecture with HTTP communications;
- - Applications that can work on the developer machine, also in the local docker network, also on distributed hardware architecture docker;
- - Applications for lightweight hardware platforms to communicate with equipment (Raspberry PI, I2C devices communications)

**What I've experienced in (rememberable past):**
- Windows Desktop Development, including:
- - WinForms - a lot of;
- - WPF - some as MVC and direct;
- - MFC - many years ago, not actual, but it was interesting;
- Database development (MS SQL), including:
- - DB Architecture development;
- - DDL, DML - SP, UDF, Triggers, etc;
- - ORMLESS communications between application and DB due to performance and more exact dealing with DBMS;
- Network, Web, and Distributed software development, including distributed on MS cluster monitoring system;
- .Net Web Applications - several projects.

**What do I want to practice in:**
- Microservice architecture;
- Cloud-distributed auto-scaling architecture;
- Azure API automation;
- AWS deployment infrastructure;
- AWS IoT infrastructure with ESP32;
- Microcontroller programming in C and C++ (currently experimenting with PIC, in the past experimented with ESP32).

**What do I want to deal with:**
- Ideally - real-life applications regarding natural things - science, nature, industry, etc. Something more important than just making some reach people more reach.

**The domains that I've experienced in:**
- Creating the software for modeling the spacecraft attitude control;
- Creating the electric energy billing software (electricity is my professional domain);
- Creating the software for monitoring the quality of other software working (for the cell operator billing software);
- Creating the exchange automatic trading software (several years of participation in this kind of project);
- Creating the crypto-exchange software (initially, it was an exciting challenge, but also it was an interesting project);
- Participation in the railway black box analysis project (a long time ago, my first real project, it was very exciting).

**The content of my bookshelf:**
- JÃ¶rg Rippel. FPGAs. Einsteig, Schaltungen,  Projekte;
- Andrew Lock. ASP.NET Core in Action, Third Edition;
- Ronald Mak. Object-Oriented Software Design in C++;
- Naomi Ceder. The Quick Python Book.

**What did I study recently:**
- FreeRTOS at my home projects;
- Some amazing Astronomy things as a domain of my current job;
- Linux C++ development - sometimes at home;
- Embedded C++ development - sometimes at home;
- FPGA - just for curiosity now, by reading a book in German with Google translate.

**What did I study in the software development area:**
- MongoDB on my little projects;
- FreeRTOS on home weekend projects;
- Amazon AWS on home weekend projects;
- MS Azure on Microsoft and the Linked In platforms;
- T-SQL in my professional practice in different projects;
- Software development in C# for many years in practical projects;
- Software development in C++ for Windows during my job in several big projects;
- Programming in Assembler, C, and C++ during my education in the university.

**What are my out-of-job interests:**
- Family;
- Photography;
- Traveling around;
- Microcontrollers, home and industry automation.

### [2024. Data exchange between docker containerized applications](https://github.com/K-S-K/CCCS)
The purpose of this project is to adjust the approach of creating several projects in different docker containers and let them communicate with each other via sockets. The project can be used as a template for creating more complex projects.

IDE: VSCode.<br>
Programming language: C++.<br>
Development environment: Linux (Ubuntu).<br>
Deployment environment: Linux (Ubuntu) on Raspberry PI.<br>

### [2021. Trading Toy](Articles/28_TradeToy/Article.md)
It is a weekend home project for experiments, research, and fun, dedicated to trading automation with the Binance exchange.

### [2021. Binance Copy Trading](Articles/27_CopyTrading/Article.md)
The copy trading project for the Binance Cryptocurrency exchange.

### [2021-2023. Pubmed article editor](Articles/06_PubMedDesktop/Article.md)
It is a small desktop application that I use to create XML files for submitting articles to the Pubmed server

### [2012-2017. Reliability Analysis System](Articles/05_EWReliability/Article.md)
It is a distributed system that collects software application diagnostics data and calculates its availability factor, draws diagrams, helps to monitor software health status, and helps to investigate accident evolve history.

### [2011-2019. Automated Trading System](Articles/04_TDATrading/Article.md)
It was a big RnD project dedicated to trading automation. We experimented with different trading algorithms for eight years and had some success, great excitement, and much experience.


### [2009-2010. SMS Station](Articles/02_SMSS/Article.md)
It is a desktop application dedicated to sending and broadcasting SMS messages via SMS user terminal connected to the computer. It may be my Best UI project.


### [2001-2007. Electric power billing project](Articles/03_ESphere/Article.md)
